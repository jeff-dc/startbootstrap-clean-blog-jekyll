<p>Apart from being a engineer and business intelligence strategist, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. You can usually find me in the gym in the early mornings. During the warmer months here in Texas, I enjoy running, hiking, and soaking up the sun. In the winter you can find me outdoors too! I love the cooler weather. When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows. I am an aspiring data scientist, project manager, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in marketing, analytics, and manufacturing.</p>
