<h2 id="a2-topic-selection-data-description">A.2 Topic Selection Data Description</h2>

<p>Austin, Tx is the technology centerpiece of the State of Texas. Nested north of San Antonio, Tx and south of Dallas/Fort Worth, Tx Austin serves as the capital of the state with a population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas">790,390 and population density of 3,182/sq mi</a>. The city has seen growth within the last decade due to large technology and software companies coming into the Central Texas Region. From 2007 - 2017 alone, the percentage population growth of the City of <a href="https://www.austinchamber.com/economic-development/austin-profile/population/overview">Austin rivaled that of the State of Texas and the United States</a>.</p>

<h3 id="population-growth-from-2007---2017"><a href="https://cdn1.austinchamber.com/archive/images/ed/chart-population-growth.jpg?mtime=20190620093848">Population Growth from 2007 - 2017</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn1.austinchamber.com/archive/images/ed/chart-population-growth.jpg?mtime=20190620093848" alt="Population Table" /></p>

<p>With this knowledge known, the focus here is to educate any interested party that would be coming to the City of Austin for work or leisure would like to know about some particular venues or hotspots within the city. Any business owners that may want to start a business in a given section of a city would also want to know what the current popular venues are in each respectable neighborhood. Those looking to buy a home would want to see what the median cost of a home would be in each neighborhood.</p>

<p>These problems will be considered and a map will be created with an informational view on clustered venues and median real estate values.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="b-methodology">B. Methodology</h1>

<p>In order to find all of this data, several sources will be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Google Sheets scripts for quickly obtaining zip codes and latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare API</a> to scrape the local area for venues in each neighborhood</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://geo.nyu.edu/">GEOJson file</a> for mapping of the Austin, Tx area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A local area analysis of housing prices obtained through <a href="https://library.austintexas.gov/database/gale-business-demographicsnow">DemographicsNow</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>First, the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of each neighborhood would be needed. The zip codes and names of these neighborhoods would be found on WIKIPEDIA and independently scraped using an external Jupyter Notebook utilizing <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup4</a>, a web scraper. Once the zip codes were identified, latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates were found via a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/ziploc.jpg">GSheets script</a>. This was stored in a GSheets file and, using the scraped data previously acquired, the neighborhoods had their names concatenated with ‚ÄúTx‚Äù so the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/geo2zip.jpg">zip codes were then able to be matched</a> to the scraped <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/MatchedNeighborhoods.jpg">neighborhoods</a>. Areas containing the same zip codes were then matched and strung together.</p>

<p>Next, the report of median housing costs would be needed. Fortunately, the Austin Virtual Library has access to <a href="https://library.austintexas.gov/database/gale-business-demographicsnow">DemographicsNow</a>, a tool which could be used to quickly obtain all relevant data in regards to median housing prices. Immediate housing prices were not available, so the data used was taken in 2018. The housing cost data was then added to the neighborhood listings.</p>

<p>All data was stored in a GitHub repository and in IBM Cognitive Class Laboratory. The data was stored as a CSV and called into a dataframe using Pandas. This resulted in the working dataframe to be used:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/DF1.jpg" alt="Dataframe, Austin" /></p>

<p><a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium</a> was used to map the local Austin area. Markers were overlayed to designate which areas consisted of neighborhoods, as designated by latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/NeighborhoodMarking.jpg" alt="Neighborhood Marking" /></p>

<p>In a previous exercise it was learned that the FourSquare API could be utilized to to explore the contents of buroughs, here defined as neighborhoods, and segment them into a local area search. Due to the large area of Austin, a radius of 5500 meters (34.18 miles) was used as a visitor may want to drive across Austin to see various sights. Venues were limited at 100 for this exercise. When FourSquare was called upon, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head()</code> of the call brought the following venues:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/FourSquareVenues.jpg" alt="FourSquare Venues" /></p>

<p>When this data was looked at as a whole, it was discovered that FourSquare included gas stations, convenience stores, and bus stops in the API feedback. Ultimately, this was left in the whole of the data as some gas stations and convenience stores in Austin have bespoke goods or services. Bus stations and street intersections were also left in to keep the whole of the FourSquare data.</p>

<p>When checked, a total of 720 separate venues within the city was met. This table was then merged with the table of the neighborhoods.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/MergedVenues.jpg" alt="Merged Neighborhoods" /></p>

<p>When the data was pooled for evaluation, there were some interesting findings. Only one neighborhood hit the limit of 100 venues per zip code, despite the fact that this is a merged zip code list. This could be due to incorrect identification by the business itself, or by not enough FourSquare reviews in certain areas.</p>

<p>It was also found that the zip codes of certain neighborhoods (WestLake Hills, NorthWest Austin, and RiverPlace) were producing errors in the data analysis and returning 0 venues. These zip codes were removed for venue analysis, but kept for housing cost analysis.</p>

<p>The original bar graph generated had shortened neighborhoods names. Full names are listed for complete viewing.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/VenuesBar.png" alt="Austin Venue Count" /></p>

<p>Out of all the venues polled by Foursquare, the noise needed to be cleared out for further analysis. A ‚ÄúTop 10‚Äù venue list was created for each neighborhood.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/TopTenVenues.jpg" alt="Top Ten Venues" /></p>

<p>Further analysis would need to be done in order to group our neighborhoods by common venues. Unsupervised K-Means clustering will be used in this instance. In order to group our venues, we will need to know what our optimal k value would be for clustering. The elbow method will be used to find this optimal k value.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/OptimalKElbow.jpg" alt="Optimal k value" /></p>

<p>Our optimal k value would be 2 in this case. This is not an optimal case for k value clustering. All venues across Austin would be grouped into two bins. In spite of what the data is saying, the k value selected will be 5 for visual purposes.</p>

<p>The venues were grouped in a ‚ÄúTop 10‚Äù fashion, yielding this table:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/GroupedTopTen.jpg" alt="Grouped Top 10" /></p>

<p>The 1st Most Common Venue can also be displayed via a bar chart.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/ClusterBar.jpg" alt="Cluster Bar Chart" /></p>

<p>Clusters were then labeled according to their contents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cluster 0: Pizza/Coffee</li>
  <li>Cluster 1: Home Stores</li>
  <li>Cluster 2: Total Austin</li>
  <li>Cluster 3: Indian Restaurants</li>
  <li>Cluster 4: Parks</li>
</ul>

<p>Housing costs were also a point of concern in this study. Referring back to our first dataset, we can put the housing prices in Austin in a histogram for visualization:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/HousingBarCost.jpg" alt="Housing Costs" /></p>

<p>Housing costs were then binned in the following ranges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less than 150,000 USD</li>
  <li>Ranging from 150,001-300,000 USD</li>
  <li>Ranging from 300,001-450,000 USD</li>
  <li>Ranging from 450,001-600,000 USD</li>
  <li>Greater than 600,000 USD</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="c-results">C. Results</h1>

<p>The data is now able to be displayed in a centralized table for final viewing and visualization.</p>

<p>First, the clusters are added into the ‚ÄúTop 10‚Äù table:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/Coursera_Capstone/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/BoTN%20Final/Snapshots/FinalTableGroup.jpg" alt="Final Table Group" /></p>

<p>Now the kmeans clustered and grouped zip codes are clearly defined on the generated map:</p>

<p>In the final map, we have a combined representation of all the data pulled and grouped for this project. A GEOJson file was downloaded from the Spacial Data Repository and used for this purpose. This map was then overlayed with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neighborhood name</li>
  <li>Cluster name</li>
  <li>Top 3 venues</li>
  <li>Color coded representation of median housing cost</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="d-discussion">D. Discussion</h1>

<p>With the continuous influx of people relocating to Austin, Tx, this information could be valuable. Austin is a growing city with many different neighborhoods that sport many different venues and costs associated with each location.</p>

<p>The methods of grouping and clustering venues throughout the city still remains in question. Although using the elbow method to identify the optimal k value to be used for k means clustering is the tried and true way of partitioning observations, it would not have yielded much to visualize in this scenario. With k = 5, the clustering was forced to group together more venues into separate clusters. This method created a more visually attainable view of the data.</p>

<p>The median home values were also taken from 2018, as this was the most current data available. However, this would still provide the reader with an overall view of the median value distribution over the city. When newer data is available, the code can be updated.</p>

<p>This information would also be of knowledge that investors, small business owners, and budding entrepreneurs would like to see. By seeing the top businesses in a given area, along with the surrounding areas, one could easily call back the dataframe containing the raw data to see each separate business to forecast investment, construction, marketing, or advertising.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="e-conclusion">E. Conclusion</h1>

<p>Planning a visit, move, or business venture always requires research. With a quick overview, one could get at a bird‚Äôs eye view of the data of the Austin, Tx area. It could be seen what to expect when coming to this city. This gives a look-ahead to investors, property managers, or city planners as well.</p>
